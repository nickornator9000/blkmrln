TODO
This command should control black formatting for the repository and should 
be built to:
1. Format the entire project
2. Format a subfolder of the project. 
NOTE
The default project selection should be the current directory IF the current
directory is a project directory. Otherwise this command should require the 
user to provide a project name via opt.
